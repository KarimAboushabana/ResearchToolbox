For my coding needs at school.

This first website currently has a home page with a list of links to resources that are available, two of which I have created html files that it links to.
The first html link is RealisticResearch.html
The second html link is Layout.html
I am not necessarily sure how to correctly link each page to the other one so I linked them using my personal computer's locations for each of the files.
